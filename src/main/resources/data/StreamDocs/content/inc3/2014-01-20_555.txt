<p>1732 UPDATE - Much of the information gathered from the GAStech employees who have been allowed to leave by police investigators point to a kidnapping of several GAStech employees. However, officials still have not confirmed a kidnapping has taken place. The number of missing employees is undetermined at this time given the earlier confusion with the false fire alarm.</p>
<p>There is some indication that the Protectors of Kronos - an activist group responsible for many recent demonstrations and riots in and around Abila - are suspected of being responsible for the kidnapping. If true, this is an alarming escalation of violence for the activist group.</p>
