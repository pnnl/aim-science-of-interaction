<p>1915 UPDATE - GAStech employee Edvard Vann was "allowed to leave" after nearly six hours of interrogation by police, government, and GAStech officials. Vann was questioned and released about fifteen minutes ago and instructed not to leave town. Vann was visibly angry about the confusion, which apparently stemmed from the similarity of his name and known members of the Protectors of Kronos.</p>
<p>Vann said he was "instructed not to communicate with the press, but I feel I have to stress my innocence. I have nothing to do whatsoever with any members of the terrorist group POK."</p>
