<p>1330 UPDATE - At 1315 we placed a call to GAStech headquarters. A hesitant administrative assistant to Orhan Strum, Chief Operating Officer of GAStech claimed Mr. Strum was unavailable. Linda Lagos the assistant to Mr. Strum declined to answer any further questions about the incident, whether or not there was a fire, a false alarm, a bomb threat, or whether or not anyone is missing.</p>
<p>Uneasy throughout the call, Ms. Lagos repeated that Orhan Strum was unavailable at this time, said good bye and hung up. Additional calls were placed with no answer on the GAStech end of the line.</p>
