<p>ABILA, Kronos - An explosion at a nearby gas drilling well pad woke Rebecca Cato around 3 a.m. on Sunday morning. When she left her home in Elodis, Kronos - a rural township outside the capital Abila - to investigate the noise she noticed a large fire coming from GAStech International's Tiskele Bend site.</p>
<p>The GAStech-owned well near Elodis ignited methane gas underground causing a fire that lasted for around an hour. At least four GAStech employees appeared to have been taken away by ambulance; however, GAStech has declined to comment on the extent and nature of their injuries. </p>
<p>GAStech's CEO Sten Sanjorge Jr. downplayed the event stating, "This event could hardly be described as an explosion," but merely a common practice referred to as flaring. He continued, "I won't bore you with the details, but a temporary flare is often used during well production testing." </p>
<p>Mrs. Cato and other locals from Elodis were turned away by GAStech employees and government officials. Eventually, locals downriver were evacuated. Rebecca Cato said, "After sending us away without a single question answered, they came to our doors and told us to leave our homes. It was the middle of the night where was I to go." </p>
