<p>ABILA, Kronos - The brazen day time assault on two peace officers by the POK is just another violent, terroristic act in a long string of such acts. The two officers were left bloody and beaten, and tied up in the trunk of their vandalized vehicle.</p>
<p>Police spokesman Adrien Carman said of the attack, "Assaulting a police officer and destroying government property are serious crimes. I want to assure the public that these men will be caught and brought to justice soon." </p>
<p>Further exacerbating the situation, the two criminals defaced the officers' car by spray painting the POK logo. </p>
<p>If they can attack two police officers in broad daylight, who is next?</p>
