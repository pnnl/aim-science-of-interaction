<p>ABILA, Kronos - Letters purported to be from the Protectors of Kronos (POK) have been received by Vincent Kapelou, Minister of Health and nephew of President Kapelou. The threatening letters appear to be the empty threats of an attention-seeking organization and nothing more.</p>
<p>Mr. Kapelou said, "Chances are this is nothing, but we're not going to take any chances." Nonetheless he has doubled the size of his personal security force in response to the letters.</p>
<p>These sorts of threats only reinforce the fact that the POK are a "public threat" to quote President Kapelou.</p>
