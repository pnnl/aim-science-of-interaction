<p>CENTRUM, Tethys - GAStech International has shifted its focus from Tethys to the small Mediterranean island of Kronos and the vast gas deposits beneath the ground.</p>
<p>Recent charges of groundwater contamination against GAStech International and tightening environmental regulations lead by the Tethan Interior Minister, Ivar Blanes, certainly play into the shifting focus. </p>
