<p>The government of Kronos has declared the Protectors of Kronos a terrorist group after blaming it for a deadly attack on police headquarters earlier this week.</p>
<p>Several of its supporters have been arrested in a crackdown.</p>
<p>A POK leader vowed that protests would continue.</p>
<p>Government spokesman Rufus Drymiau announced the move, which will give the authorities more power to crack down on the POK.</p>
<p>He said that those who belonged to the group, financed it or promoted its activities would face punishment.</p>

<p>The Protectors of Kronos</p>
<p>    Kronos's oldest and largest environmental activist organization</p>
<p>    Founded in 1997.</p>
<p>    Influenced by international groups such as Wellness for All</p>
<p>    Mixes political activism with environmental work</p>
<p>    Rejects use of violence and supports democratic principles</p>
<p>    Slogan: "Justice for Juliana", a reference to a 10-year old Kronosian girl who died as a result of government sponsored environmental contamination </p>
<p>The decision was in response to Tuesday's bombing of a police headquarters in Abila, he said.</p>
<p>"Kronos was horrified from north to south by the hideous crime committed by the POK," Mr. Drymiau said.</p>
<p>"This was in context of dangerous escalation to violence against Kronos and Kronosians and a clear declaration by the POK that it knows nothing but violence.</p>
<p>"It's not possible for Kronos the state nor Kronos the people to submit to the POK terrorism."</p>
<p>Kronos would notify Tethys who had signed a 1998 anti-terrorism treaty of the decision, he added.</p>
<p>POK supporters</p>
<p>The POK has denied being responsible for the attack, and accused the Kronos government of staging a frame-up to silence the groups concerns for the people.</p>
<p>A POK member told the Times that the government's decision was "illegitimate".</p>
<p>He added: "The protests will continue, certainly."</p>
